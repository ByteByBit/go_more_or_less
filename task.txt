GoMoreOrLess
You are tasked with creating a GoMore competitor! Please write an interactive program that
allows the user to create and search for rides between cities.
The program should present a prompt to the user and accept the following commands:
- C from-city to-city date number-of-seats
Create a new ride from from-city to to-city on date with number-of-seats available for
booking.
- R date
Create a return-trip on date using the last created ride as a template.
- S [from-city [to-city]] [from-date [to-date]] [minimum-free-seats]
Search for rides between cities in the specified date range with the specified number of
seats available. All parameters are optional. Please see examples below for some
combinations.
